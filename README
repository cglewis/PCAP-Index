OVERVIEW
This is a set of scripts to index a PCAP file into a SQLite3 DB and allow you to recover them VERY quickly.


WHY
Going through PCAPs with tcpdump is slow. Precious minutes eat away at concentration.


HISTORY
The first results for PCAP indexing from google are:
 - http://geek00l.blogspot.com/2008/03/sancp-pcap-index.html
 - http://blog.vorant.com/2008/04/pcap-indexing.html
This is the same idea I followed and showed very good speed improvements. The problem was too much coupling. SANCP is a nice tool, but I didn't want to couple a meta data extraction tool to direct packet recovery. One of the problems is with SANCP sessionizing - I'm not sure how good it is as I've seen it do some very odd things when analyzing PCAP files.

Most of the original code for this project was created during the last couple of days of a course in packet analysis that I was disappointed with. 


BUILDING
The only thing that needs to be built is the index_pkts.c file. Simply run:

	$ gcc -lpcap -o index_pkts index_pkts.c
